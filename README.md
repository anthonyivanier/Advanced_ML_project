# Advanced_ML_project

Project for the Advanced Machine Learning class of 2023-2024 at ENSAE. Taught by Mr.Stromme.

Group members : Elias Jeannot and Anthony Ivanier

The goal of the project is to implement two methods (CNN and landmarks-based approaches) to sign language recognition.

Two datasets were used. Our own dataset build with webcam pictures and the Sign language MNIST dataset available on Kaggle.

The github countains four notebooks.

Own_CNN is the first notebook of the project. It's goal is to help understand what happens inside a CNN. The functions used in the different layers of CNN are implemented from scratch.

CNN_train countains the code to apply CNN to the MNIST dataset.

data_recovery.ipynb countains the creation of our own dataset.

data_analysis.ipynb countains the application of a NN on our dataset.
